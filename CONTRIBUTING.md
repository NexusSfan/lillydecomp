## Disassembly
In order to get the disassembled code, you need to have Stella 7.0 installed.
Load the Lilly Adventure ROM (binary sha256: 6431a0ef0586e411304782da34ddc7d10f3d0028daeb95a6181d2860d1c028e3) into Stella. Press "`" and then run "saveDis".
Now you have the disassembled assembly.

There's no good tools for this yet.

## Compiling
We are using [cc2600](https://github.com/steux/cc2600) to compile the code.
